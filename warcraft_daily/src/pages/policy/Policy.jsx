              Like most website operators, Wildcard Esports collects
              non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
              browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
              type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
              of each visitor request. Wildcard Esports's purpose in collecting
              non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
              Wildcard Esports's visitors use its website. From time to time,
              Wildcard Esports may release non-personally-identifying
              information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
              trends in the usage of its website.

              Wildcard Esports also collects potentially personally-identifying
              information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
              users and for users leaving comments on{" "}
              <span>https://www.wildcardesports.gg</span> blog posts. Wildcard
              Esports only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses
              under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
              personally-identifying information as described below.
