      "We have heard that he used to take over for a certain Ice-Dog Mage during Dungeons and Mythic+ farming sessions, but we can tell the difference because he is always barking orders. Normally a very strong player when it comes to mechanics, but was always distracted during Mythic BoneLord for some reason, so we had to swap him to a part of the Organization. Now he is fetching coffee and snacks for us like a good boy - He is our Paladin of Love and Retribution.",
