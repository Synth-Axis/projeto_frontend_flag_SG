    subText2:
      "Fyrakk Assaults are first unlocked once you complete Chapter 3 of the Patch 10.1 campaign questline, The Ancient Bargain. Once this chapter is done and Fyrakk leaves Zaralek Cavern, a Kalecgos Mirror Image offers the quest Fyrakk's Forces, which serves as a breadcrumb directing you to an assault area, called a Suffusion Camp.    After you unlock Fyrakk Assaults, the Dragon Isles world map will have a new Fyrakk-themed icon, showing which zone the Primal Incarnate is attacking. Additionally, Fyrakk Assaults are an account-wide unlock, which means you only need to unlock them once for your entire account to gain access to them.",

      "Once you approach the area assaulted by Fyrakk, the atmosphere will change dramatically, with the skies turning fiery orange and the area surrounded by Primalist forces. It is a striking change, especially when compared to more cool-colored areas like the snowy plains of the Azure Span.",

    subText2:
      "Players will receive their Dragonriding mounts from completing main storyline quests in the Dragon Isles. There are five Dragonriding mounts, and there are no differences between them besides appearance. Like most mounts, Dragonriding mounts are account-wide, and once learned alts on your character can immediately Dragonride in the Dragon Isles. You currently can only use Dragonriding mounts in the Dragon Isles - Attempting to mount a Dragonriding mount outside the Dragon Isles will give you an error message.",
    subTitle3: "Dragonriding Basics",
    subText3:
      "There are physics involved into Dragonriding: You will gain more speed when propelling yourself downwards, and lose speed when moving upwards. Using Vigor abilities will help you gain momentum. If you spend too long in the air without attempting to gain momentum, your mount will lose speed and eventually run out of steam. When this happens, your mount will slowly land to the ground. Because of this, AFKing in the air while Dragonriding is not possible.",

There's also Symbiotic Bloom, Motes of Possibility, Inferno's Blessing, Bestow Weyrnstone and all of Evokers regular utility like Time Spiral, Zephyr, Blessing of the Bronze and more. The Augmentation spec tree is filled to the brim with utility to the point where it can be tough to find many personal damage increases.",
    subTitle3: "A Simple Rotation",
    subText3:
      "You're basically playing a slightly easier version of the Devastation rotation but without some of the flair. You run out of your big buttons quite quickly and spend quite a lot of your rotation casting filler. We don't need every spec to be ultra complex, but Augmentation is maybe a little too simple right now. There's a chance that they feel being a support spec is already sufficient complexity but as we'll discuss below, Augmentations DPS-support abilities feel very passive. There's maybe room to expand the gameplay loop a little bit, or maybe to include more core support abilities that require active use like Prescience.",
